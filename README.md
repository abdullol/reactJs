# React
- it is library developed using JS and html
- 

# React Hooks
 - They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
 - we have couple of React Hooks (e.g. useState, useEffect)
 - managing your component's state or performing an after effect when certain changes occur in state without writing class.\
[useState](#) :- 
 returns a stateful value and function to update it. The returned function accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.\
[useEffect](#) :- 
 function passed to it will run after the render is committed to the screen. it usually run after completed render but we can set it to fire after certain values are changed.\
